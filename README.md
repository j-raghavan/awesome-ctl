> Tired of wrestling with cryptic error messages and complex troubleshooting? **awesome-ctl** is like having a seasoned expert on call 24/7, using the power of AI to provide clear, actionable diagnoses for your infrastructure and applications.

**awesome-ctl** is a command-line tool that brings cutting-edge LLM (Large Language Model) technology to the forefront of systems diagnostics.  Connect **awesome-ctl** to your Kubernetes cluster, Docker Swarm, AWS environment, or other supported systems, and let our AI analyze the data to help you find and fix issues faster.

## ‚ú®  Key Features

* **üß†  AI-Driven Insights:**  **awesome-ctl** leverages the reasoning power of LLMs to analyze complex technical data and provide human-readable diagnoses and recommendations.
* **üîå Extensible Connector Architecture:**  Easily connect to a variety of systems and services:
    - **Kubernetes:** Get to the bottom of pod crashes, deployment issues, resource bottlenecks, and more.
    - **Docker:** Diagnose container failures, image build problems, and networking issues.
    - **AWS (Coming Soon):**  Analyze CloudWatch logs, EC2 instance health, and other AWS services.
    - **More to Come:**  We're constantly adding support for new systems!
* **üîç  Deep System Analysis:**  **awesome-ctl** gathers the essential information to provide comprehensive diagnoses:
    - Logs and Events:  Analyze system and application logs to identify errors, warnings, and patterns.
    - Resource Utilization: Understand CPU, memory, network usage, and other metrics to spot bottlenecks.
    - Configuration Data:  Detect misconfigurations and potential conflicts.
* **üõ† Actionable Recommendations:**  Don't just identify problems - fix them! **awesome-ctl** provides clear steps and guidance to help you resolve issues quickly.
* **ü§ñ Easy-to-Use CLI:**  A simple and intuitive command-line interface makes diagnostics a breeze.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üõ† Prerequisites

* **Python 3.8+:**  The language of **awesome-ctl**.
* **Connectors:** Install the necessary connector libraries for the systems you want to diagnose (e.g., `kubernetes`, `docker`).

### üì• Installation

```bash
poetry add awesome-ctl
```

üíª Usage

Basic Diagnostics:
